> Web application for the Emojitracker frontend and the old
version of the REST API.

While this is shockingly still running in production, the plan is to migrate
off this frontend to a new one rewritten from scratch to be more maintainable,
hosted as static files and running on top of the newer [REST API][rest-api].

:wave: _Help wanted! Front-end devs (especially if you have experience in high
performance React/Redux etc) if you are interested in helping out, [please get
in touch][contact]!_ :ghost:
