# Contributor Guidelines (kinda)

While this is shockingly still running in production, the plan is to migrate
off this frontend to a new one rewritten from scratch to be more maintainable,
hosted as static files and running on top of the newer [REST API][rest-api].

:wave: _Help wanted! Front-end devs (especially if you have experience in high
performance React/Redux etc) if you are interested in helping out, [please get
in touch][contact]!_ :ghost:
