# Contributor Guidelines (kinda)

While this is shockingly still running in production, the plan is to migrate
off this frontend to a new one rewritten from scratch to be more maintainable,
hosted as static files and running on top of the newer [REST API][rest-api].

:wave: _Help wanted! Front-end devs (especially if you have experience in high
performance React/Redux etc) if you are interested in helping out, [please get
in touch][contact]!_ :ghost:

## Development Setup

### Frontend + REST API

 1. Make sure you have Ruby 2.2.x installed and `gem install bundler`.
 2. Get the repository and basic dependencies going:

        git clone mroth/emojitrack
        cd emojitrack
        bundle install --without=production

 3. Copy `.env-sample` to `.env` and configure required variables.
 4. Make sure you have Redis installed and running.  The rules in `lib/config.rb` currently dictate the order a redis server instance is looked for.  Depending on what you are doing, you may need to have the db populated from a emojitrack-feeder instance.
 5. Run all processes via `foreman start`.
